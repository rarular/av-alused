TCP - Transmission Control Protocol. a set of rules that governs the delivery of data over the Internet or other network that uses the Internet Protocol, and sets up a connection between the sending and receiving computers. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network
UDP- User Datagram Protocol. Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish a connection prior to data transfer.
